## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Simon, a full-stack developer in London

Currently I'm a software craftsperson at Codurance working hard with our clients to build clean, sustainable and effective code. 

I'm passionate about crafting code which has an impact and unashamedly addicted to problem-solving any issues along the way. In a past life I was a qualified accountant, so nothing makes me happier than a well organised database; there is nothing some well-placed SQL can't solve.  

When not sitting in front of a computer-screen I spend my days language learning and taking some time to get out into nature. 

### What I'm doing now

- Iâ€™m currently working on a .NET project implementing essential user processes
- Developing and improving a Xamarin-based mobile app
