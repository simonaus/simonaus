## Hi there 👋, I'm Simon, a full-stack developer in London

Currently I'm a full-stack developer at boGo working to change the way we travel and connect across the globe.

I'm passionate about crafting code which has an impact and unashamedly addicted to problem-solving any issues along the way. In a past life I was a qualified accountant, so nothing makes me happier than a well organised database; there is nothing some well-placed SQL can't solve.  

When not sitting in front of a computer-screen I spend my days language learning 🌏 (grammar-nerd) and taking some time to get out into nature. 🌳

### What I'm doing now

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a social-connections focused [Matchmaker App](https://github.com/simonaus/matchmaker) using React Native
- 💬 Ask me about React Native and React Native testing philosophies
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've called the UK home for nearly 4 years
